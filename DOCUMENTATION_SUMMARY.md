- **GUI Framework**: LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)
- **CAN Communication**: TWAI driver for automotive CAN bus integration
- **Multi-Vehicle Support**: Configurable protocols for different vehicle manufacturers

### Key Components
- **CarCanController**: Central coordinator managing vehicle state and CAN communication
- **CarCanGui**: LVGL-based user interface with vehicle selection, speed control, and gear selection
