# Setting Up GitHub Actions and Release Page

Follow these steps to set up automatic documentation building and create your first release with the Sphinx documentation.

## Step 1: Push All Files to GitHub

First, make sure all the documentation files I created are in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Add all the new documentation files
git add docs/ .github/ *.md
git commit -m "Add comprehensive Sphinx documentation and GitHub Actions workflow"
git push origin main
```

## Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. Choose branch: **`gh-pages`**
6. Choose folder: **`/ (root)`**
7. Click **Save**

## Step 3: Wait for First Build

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run when you push. You can monitor it:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You should see a workflow run called "Build and Release Documentation"
4. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)

## Step 4: Create Your First Release

Once the workflow has run successfully:

```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will trigger the release creation workflow.

## Step 5: Access Your Documentation

After the workflows complete, you'll have:

### üåê Live Documentation (GitHub Pages)
Your documentation will be available at:
```
https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/
```

### üì¶ Release Page
Your releases will be available at:
```
https://github.com/[your-username]/[repository-name]/releases
```

### üìÅ Downloadable Documentation
Each release will include:
- **HTML Documentation ZIP**: Interactive documentation
- **PDF Documentation ZIP**: Printable version

## Expected Timeline

- **Immediate**: Workflow starts running when you push
- **2-3 minutes**: Documentation builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
- **Additional 1-2 minutes**: Release is created when you push a tag

## What You'll Get

### On the Release Page:
- Professional release notes with feature descriptions
- Download links for HTML and PDF documentation
- Link to live online documentation
- Automatic version management

### Live Documentation Features:
- Responsive design (works on mobile)
- Search functionality
- Cross-referenced navigation
- Professional Read the Docs theme

## Troubleshooting

### If the workflow fails:
1. Check the **Actions** tab for error details
2. Ensure all files are committed and pushed
3. Verify the `docs/requirements.txt` file exists
4. Check that Python dependencies can be installed

### If GitHub Pages doesn't work:
1. Verify you selected `gh-pages` branch in Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Wait a few minutes after the first successful workflow run
3. Check that the workflow created the `gh-pages` branch

### If no release is created:
1. Ensure you pushed a tag starting with 'v' (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. Check the Actions tab for the "create-release" job
3. Verify the workflow completed successfully

## Future Releases

For subsequent releases:

```bash
# Create new version tags
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

Each tag will automatically:
- Build updated documentation
- Create a new release
- Update the live documentation site

## Customization

You can customize the release notes by creating a `CHANGELOG.md` file in your repository root. The workflow will automatically extract release notes from it.
